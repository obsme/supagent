"""0.9: compare_logs, what the logs say that they do not usually. The lines of a log table grouped into patterns
(numbers, times, ids, names and quoted values left out; a list of names is one), each counted against the same
window of the earlier days that have data: the new patterns, the ones far above usual and the rare ones first,
with where their lines come from (the fields of few values, the names they hold) and when; a pattern as frequent
as usual whose numbers are far from their usual (a slow write of 40 s every night 8 s); what is gone; the patterns
of every night said as usual; reference days. The patterns said are counted line by line in the database. Nothing
here knows a kind of log."""
