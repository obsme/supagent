"""0.9: every interaction of the System map explained, twice: a short explanation (a few words, shown when the link
is clicked on the map: never drawn on it) and a long one (what to do when an investigation follows it), given to
the agent with the system around a question and by system_links; the LLM writes them for the interactions it
reads in a text and for the others (an admin's, an older one), never over what an admin wrote. And the order of the
night: the classification runs right after the Context is built, on what it wrote."""
