"""What an investigation blames, checked against the system (0.9).

An investigation's answer that names a part of the system as the cause (a server, a pool, a service, a feed...)
must tie it to what the question is about. The check is plain: the part is tied when the system map links it to
the question's parts within two steps (what they run on, depend on, read, call, consist of, are part of), or when
a result of the answer's own queries on those parts shows it. A part that is neither (servers of another pool
that had an alert that night) is sent back once, then marked: the cause of somebody else's problem.

It judges nothing else: whether a tied part really is the cause stays the investigation's own work.
