"""The interactions the logs show, proposed for the System map (0.9).

A batch scheduler writes what a run waits for ("APP_B.RATES.EU.02 still waiting for its inputs after 40 min:
APP_A.RATES.EU, MD_EOD_RATES"), an application what it calls ("request to MDCACHE took 840 ms") or where it writes
("commit to RESULTS_DB took 3.2 s"). Each such line names the part it comes from (a field of the log table holding
the values of a category: its application) and the parts it names in its text. With the classification, the
recent lines of each log table are read (the latest of each of the last days), grouped into patterns
(knowledge.logs), and each pair of parts a pattern ties on enough lines and days is proposed as an interaction,
its kind read in the pattern's words (waits for, inputs: depends on; calls, requests: calls; reads, loads: reads
from; writes, publishes, commits: sends data to). A pattern that states no interaction (a GC pause on a server, a
free slot) proposes nothing. A proposal waits in To review with its evidence (how many lines, on how many days, an
example), like the ones the LLM reads in the documents; nothing is drawn or followed before an admin approves it,
and a rejected one is never proposed again. Measured on a simulated platform against its real dependencies: 18 of
18 found, none wrong (lab-private research).

Nothing here knows a kind of system: a table with a time field, a text field and a field of a category's values.
