"""One learning run: every osagg and promagg database (or the ones of learn.databases) is read
as the learning user, one after the other, and what changed since the last run is recorded. While
they are read, the LLM describes what nobody described yet (supagent.knowledge.describer: after
the catalog, as the objects are learned); once every database is read, the relations between them
all are measured, the catalog is applied, and the time left describes what is still missing. The
databases left out, and why, are in the run's statistics. An admin can stop a run (the Stop
button): it ends as "stopped", keeping what it learned.

Runs every day at learn.hour (Celery beat, task supagent.learn_tick), from the admin page
("Learn now") or with `superset supagent learn`. A run stops after learn.max_minutes; the
next one starts with what was not learned (new objects first, then the oldest profiles).

The databases never learned come first (one just added is learned the same day), and each
database gets a fair share of the time left (the time left divided by the databases left), so
that a very big one (thousands of metrics) cannot keep the others waiting for days: it goes on
at the next run. The settings page shows, while the run goes, the database being learned, the
ones still to come, and the ones left out with the reason.

One run at a time for all the web servers and workers: starting a run holds a row lock
(supagent_meta 'learn:start') while it checks that none is running."""
