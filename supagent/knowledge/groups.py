"""How a measure of a table compares with its usual, group by group (0.9): the figures behind the tool
compare_groups. For each value of a field (an application, a server, a step...), the measure over a window against
the same window of the earlier days that have data (their median): which values are off, and whether the change
is concentrated on a few of them (a cause is usually where the excess is) or spread over all (then the field is
not what explains it).

No LLM and nothing about a domain: a table, a measure, a scope, fields to group by. The queries are plain
aggregations the connectors push down (one per window and field).
