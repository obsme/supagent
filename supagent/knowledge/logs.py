"""What the logs say that they do not usually: the messages of a log table grouped into patterns, each pattern
counted against the same window of the earlier days (compare_logs).

A pattern is a message with what changes from one line to the next left out: the numbers, the times, the ids
(`GC overhead on node105: heap 97% used` and `... node107: heap 95% used` are one pattern), the names written
as identifiers (`no free slot on GRID_EU_STD for RISKCALC.RATES.EMEA.01`, a list of them as one) and the
quoted values. What a pattern leaves out is kept by its place: the names (a name that most of its lines hold is
written back when the pattern is said: `no free slot on GRID_EU_STD for <name>`), the numbers (a slow
write of 40 s tonight where it is 8 s every night). Nothing here knows a kind of system or of log: a table, a time
field, a message field, a level field when there is one, and the fields of few values that say where a line comes
from."""
