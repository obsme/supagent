"""Learning the metrics of a Prometheus / Mimir database (promagg), gently.

Every run (cheap, for every metric): the list of metrics and the metadata API (type, unit,
HELP text) - two or three requests for the whole database.

Profiles (for the metrics that are due): a metric is profiled when it is new, and then on its
own day of a rolling cycle of learn.profile_every_days days (its name decides the day), so
that the work of a week is spread over the week. A profile costs about one request of its own:
  * how many series have a sample now: one query for up to 50 metrics (count by __name__, the
    series index of the live samples; metrics known to be big are counted alone);
  * the value statistics over the window, one query per metric: rates for counters, p50 / p95
    for histograms, min / max / avg for gauges (skipped above learn.stats_max_series series, one
    hour of data above 50,000);
  * a sample of the series: the labels and their values (the values are what the relations with
    index fields are measured on); metrics with a few series share one series request, the
    others have their own (at most learn.series_sample series).
The depth of the history (first sample, series index only, no samples read) is measured with
the time left once every due metric is profiled: never measured first, then every 30 days; for
live metrics about 8 label-index requests per 50 metrics (to the window: 60, 45, 30, 21, 14, 7,
3, 1 days), a metric that stopped alone (bisected to the day); the last sample of a metric that
stopped, when it stops. Thousands of metrics are thus profiled in
a few runs (each run continues where the previous one stopped), then refreshed day by day.

Every request goes through the throttle (rate limit, breaker): see throttle.py.
