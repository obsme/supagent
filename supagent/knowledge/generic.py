"""Generic questions: what a learned answer and a chat are named.

A question often carries the data of one case ("why is job 202609253742945492 failing?",
"the same for BILLING", "the @timestamp_date is a timestamp"). Stored as it is, it cannot be
recognised the next time, and it keeps data that is useless later. After each answer the
LLM writes (one short call, after the answer is shown):

  question   the question the final query answered, standalone (the earlier messages taken
             into account when the last one only continues or corrects them), short and
             generic: "Why did a given job fail?", "Failed jobs per application on a given day"
  title      two to six words for the chat ("Failed job details")

Without the LLM (an error), a plain version is made (values replaced by <id>, <date>, ...)
and marked not generic, so that the daily learning writes it again later. The daily
learning also rewrites the learned answers and chat names made before this existed, and
merges the learned answers that turn out to be the same.

  * every value of this particular case is replaced by its kind: application, server or team
