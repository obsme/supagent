"""The router (MOA): the kind of work a question needs, read by the LLM from the question's meaning, from the
knowledge the question touches and from the routes people confirmed before. The routes are the same for every
deployment; nothing here is about a business domain: what is specific to a deployment comes from its own
knowledge and its own confirmed examples.

  functional      the business meaning or the business figures of the data
  technical       how the systems work: applications, components, jobs, data flows, configuration, what a
                  technical field or metric means
  incident        what went wrong and why, now or over a past period: a failure, a delay, an error spike, a slowdown
  charts          Superset charts and dashboards themselves: find, show, explain, build or change one
  observability   detect issues: is everything normal, anomalies, health, alerts, compared with usual
  infrastructure  servers and services: CPU, memory, disk, network, latency, errors, availability

A route chooses the knowledge given first, the tools offered and a short instruction; the way the answer runs
(classic or governed) stays the deployment's. Not sure: the normal way, as before. The LLM scores every kind
(0-100); the confidence is how far the best is ahead of the next (a model's own "high" says little).

Learning, reliably: an answer people confirmed (Helpful, an admin's confirmation, the reply to a question back)
whose execution followed its route becomes an example. Examples of similar questions are shown to the LLM (how
this team names things); examples of the same question (close enough) are not shown: they only vote, and decide
only when two or more agree, or when an admin set the route itself (Data dictionary, To review: kept or corrected;
an admin confirming the answer judged the answer, not its route). One wrong example never decides alone.
